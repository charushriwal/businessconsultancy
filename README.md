Website on Business Consultancy----

I have created a responsive application with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I have created a website on "Business Consultancy" which contains 9 webpages including Home, About us, Contact Us, Our Team, Services pages. I have taken simple colors for the website and have kept essential navigation links inside the navigation bar. Home page has bootstrap carousel images and one of the page has “accordion (jquery)”. I have also added an About page to describe the company and what services it provides to clients. I have also made separate pages for each service such as Strategy Page, Decision Support Page, Digital Transformation Page, Delivery Page.

Need of the website-
A professional consulting website is an essential marketing tool that acts as the door to your business' online presence. More than that, your website makes it possible for potential clients to find you with the click of a button and acts as their first impression of your firm.
